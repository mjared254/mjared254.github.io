### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

   Lab 11, part-1 was one of my favorite lab it opened my mine to deeper programming like functions and vectors, here we used functions to determine certain characteristics of States like population were vectors were used to store data.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 , The Spell Checker lab is also one of my favorites as I found it really interesting on how a Spell Checker is built from the ground up by using a series of functions. 

* Lab 12
    Lab 12, one of the coolest labs learning how to work with colors and code was tight, as we learned how incorporate colors to make several cool projects that were different from other Lab's in this class.
